A library to assist path planning and execution

## Shark.EXE
A library built to run paths generated by the bezier splies on the PathPlanner application by Michael Jenson with another library I made named SwerveyShark.
### SharkExecutor
A java program that can load a reformatted CSV containing pathplanner data (reformatted by my PathExtrapolator program) and then execute using the populated CSV with real life data such as velocity in m/s and positional data in meters
### SharkState
A data class containing all the data that make up each line of the path's CSV file

## SharkER (WIP)
A library built to record robot odometry and subsystem data autonomously and then prepare a CSV for later execution
